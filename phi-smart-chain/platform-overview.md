# ðŸŒˆ Platform Overview

Some of the information present in this page might not apply to private and purpose-built iterations of the PHI Smart Chain protocol. â€‹[PHI Network](../) features 3 base layers: **Core Layer** (previously known as Layer Zero), **Bridging Layer** (previously known as Layer One), and **Execution Layer** (previously known as Layer Two). It also leverages a **Subnet Layer** on top of its Execution Layer, which allows for further scaling and broadening of the network's applications in the future, including purpose-built networks for enterprises, governmental, or public usage. Each one of these layers play a key role on securing the network and allowing participants to interact with it. [Validators](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#v) make up the entirety of the Execution Layer, and aside from compliance checks, they need to consign PHI **625,000** to be granted a [validator key](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#v).

## Public Ledgers <a href="#public-ledgers" id="public-ledgers"></a>

â€‹[PHI Network](../) currently leverages on 2 [publicly accessible ledgers](platform-overview.md#public-ledgers), that participants can use to connect and interact with the network on a trust-less and decentralized environment. These ledgers were initially deployed by PHI Labs, but are maintained by [validators](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#v) spread across the globe to ensure decentralization, security, and mitigate tampering of the network's state.

### PL1: PHI Smart Chain <a href="#pl1-nova-network" id="pl1-nova-network"></a>

Used as PHI Network's mainnet, it leverages PHI as its native currency, and can be used by individuals, institutions, governments, and enterprises to develop, deploy, and maintain trustless and unstoppable applications.

## Enterprise, Governmental, and Private Applications <a href="#enterprise-governmental-and-private-applications" id="enterprise-governmental-and-private-applications"></a>

Our technology can be used to deploy private infrastructure, that can further bolster productivity and allow for better and trustless workflow for individuals, governments, and enterprises. PHI Network. is constantly updating and upgrading its enterprise-level suite of applications, that like no other mainstream platforms, allow for setup and deployment of a private production-grade blockchain in less than one minute.

## Smart Contracts Ready <a href="#smart-contracts-ready" id="smart-contracts-ready"></a>

Developers can deploy with ease on [PHI Network](../) as it is [Solidity](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s) compatible out-of-the-box. It leverages on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#e), and is compatible with well-known and wide used IDEs, such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).Being [Solidity](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s) compatible also means that it is easier for participants to fork existing open-source platforms from other networks, into [PHI Network.](../)

## Scaling and Multilayering <a href="#scaling-and-multilayering" id="scaling-and-multilayering"></a>

â€‹[PHI Network](https://phi.network) is built to be scalable and future proof. Its multilayering mechanism allows for further development on top of its Execution Layer, making possible the implementation of subnets using different consensus mechanisms. This enables massive scaling potential without compromising the core security and decentralization elements of the core network.

### Core Layer <a href="#core-layer" id="core-layer"></a>

As the name suggests, this is the core layer of the network, and it's comprised by several Core Layer Nodes. Each one of these nodes stores a complete history of the network, and can also act as a [Validator](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#v) in case of major problem or even complete failure of the Execution and Bridging layers. It guarantees that the network is unstoppable and resilient.

### Bridging Layer <a href="#bridging-layer" id="bridging-layer"></a>

The bridging layer is comprised by an array of nodes acting as active bridges between the Execution Layer and the Core Layer. All transactions submitted to an Execution Layer node passes through a Bridging Layer node, which then broadcasts it to a Core Layer node, that permanently records and seals the information into the network's history book, or ledger. This mechanism allows easy mitigation of attacks, or tampering attempts from any Execution Layer nodes by breaking the link between the attacking node and the main network ledger. In these cases a fork with the tampered records is created and disconnected away, instead of it being sealed and recorded as a legitimate part of the main public ledger.

### Execution Layer <a href="#execution-layer" id="execution-layer"></a>

It is comprised by the [Validator Nodes](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#v), which are used to seal new network blocks, as well as to allow connection and communication with the network via public or private [RPCs](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r).

### Subnet Layer <a href="#subnet-layer" id="subnet-layer"></a>

Built on top of the execution layer, Subnet Layer nodes allow for seamless future implementation of scaling solutions, including purpose-built public subnet ledgers and private or public third-party blockchains or [DAGs](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#d).â€‹
