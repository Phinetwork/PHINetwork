# ❓ Φ$ FAQ

## Can I use Φ$ in other networks?

We officially support Φ$ exclusively on PHI Network. Other platforms and protocols might opt to offer support for it outside PHI Network, but caution is always recommended. The general advice is to always check these platform's Φ$ bridging reserves and liquidity before start using them.

## Is Φ$ an algorithmic stablecoin?

Φ$ is an algorithmic soft-pegged stablecoin backed by reserves held by PHI Network treasury.

## What if it loses its peg?

One Φ$ will always be worth one US Dollar, and there will be platforms available for redemption in fiat and/or other stablecoins in different networks. This makes price balancing by arbitrage extremely likely, and over and above that we also have other mechanisms to ensure the price gets back to peg even on an eventual decoupling event.



## Can I redeem Φ$ in fiat or other stablecoins?

You can redeem Φ$ for any other stablecoin or token available on PHI Network using any decentralized exchange with enough liquidity to back up the transaction. Phi Labs is also working on direct fiat on and offramp options for users, which should become available to the broader community in the future.
