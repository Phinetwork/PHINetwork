# üìç Pegging & Backing

## How does the pegging of Œ¶$ work?

Œ¶$ has a soft-peg to the value of the US Dollar, and its price are constantly rebalanced to ensure the 1:1 ratio to the USD is maintained. It does it with the help of the following mechanisms:

* Supply rebasing (aka burning, minting tokens),
* Increasing and decreasing of the backing reserves' ratio,
* Open market price arbitrage,

[PHI Labs](https://philabs.org) is also working to offer officially supported fiat onramp and offramp options for users to buy in and cash out of Œ¶$ on a fixed 1:1 ratio to the US Dollar, which will further strengthen its pegging on-chain.

## What backs Œ¶$?

Œ¶$ is backed by Œ¶ at a minimum of a 5:1 ratio. That means that for every $1 worth of Œ¶$, there are $5 worth of Œ¶ in reserves backing it.

All these reserves can be audited in real-time by the community and the treasury wallet address will be made available to the general public.
