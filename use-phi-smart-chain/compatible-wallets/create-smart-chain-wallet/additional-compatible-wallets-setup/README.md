### Alternative RPCs <a href="#alternative-rpcs" id="alternative-rpcs"></a>

We only recommend the usage of alternative [RPCs](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r) for advanced users, or if the main [RPC](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r) isn't working for you. Please get in touch with[ support team](https://phi.support) if you can't connect to the network. Some wallets - mostly on mobile devices - won't accept non-SSL RPCs.&#x20;

## Connecting to Private Ledger <a href="#connecting-to-private-ledger" id="connecting-to-private-ledger"></a>

If you have deployed and is trying to connect to a private ledger, you will have to setup your own RPC, and use a regular wallet to connect to it.The settings can change on a case-to-case basis, and more documentation with specific instructions will be produced once we have launched our private ledger applications suite.

## Want to deploy a public RPC? <a href="#want-to-deploy-a-public-rpc" id="want-to-deploy-a-public-rpc"></a>

If you want to deploy your own public[ RPC, ](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r)you can liaise with the [integration team](https://phi.support) so they can guide you through the process. Deploying a public [RPC ](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r)is a great public service to our community, as it effectively broadens our public connection bandwidth and ensures that users will still be able to interact with the network on an event where our public [RPCs](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#r) are down or overloaded.
