<summary>How Does Phiswap Protocol Work?</summary>

Phiswap is an automated market maker. In practical terms, it is a collection of smart contracts that define a standard way to create liquidity pools, provide liquidity, and swap assets.

Each liquidity pool contains two assets. The pools keep track of aggregate liquidity reserves and the pre-defined pricing strategies set by liquidity providers. Reserves and prices are updated automatically every time someone trades. There is no central order book, no third-party custody, and no private order matching engine.

Because reserves are automatically rebalanced after each trade, a Phiswap pool can always be used to buy or sell a token â€” unlike traditional exchanges, traders do not need to match with individual counter-parties to complete a trade.
