### Creating New Liquidity Pools For Tokens

![](../../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_731DFD32F050-1.jpeg)

When Creating A pool For The First Time That Hasn't Been Created Previously For A New Token You Will Need To Set The Initial Rate Of The Token or Tokens.&#x20;

The Recommendation Is To First Set The Price With USDT Because It Is Easy To Do The Calculations. The Tokens Initial Price Is Derived From The Ratio Of Tokens That Are Supplied On Both Sides.

Once You Have Set The USDT Price Of Your Token.&#x20;

Get The Current Price Of PHI/USDT&#x20;

Divide Your Tokens Price per USDT By The Price Of PHI To Know How Many Tokens You Will Need To Supply Per PHI To Have Your Price Rates Consistent Across Both liquidity Pools.&#x20;
