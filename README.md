## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

[PHI Smart Chain](https://explorer.phi.network) is a open-source [DAG](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#d) programable [smart contracts](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s) platform built for decentralized and enterprise-level applications, in one highly scalable [ecosystem](https://phi.network/resources). PHI Network is home for digital store of value, decentralized infrastructure, and applications, ready and built to scale for global usage and adoption. It is compatible and interoperable with Ethereum and other [EVM](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#e) networks, and [Solidity](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s) is natively compatible, making it easy and quick for Ethereum developers to build, deploy, or fork from existing open-source infrastructure built on other networks. A noticeable difference between PHI Network and other decentralized networks is the structuring of our consensus protocol. It leverages on a novel concept named [Hybrid Consensus Algorithm,](./#hybrid-consensus-approach) and ensures decentralization, quick [finality](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#f), and high [throughput](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#t), without compromising on scalability and energy efficiency.

#### PHI, **Î¦**

PHI- or **Î¦** - is the native token of PHI Network. It is a low supply and scarce asset that is used to pay for usage fees, to secure PHI public ledgers, as a means of exchange, payment, and as a basic unit of account for applications and protocols. Validators receive **Î¦** as reward for sealing a block, and part of the usage fees users pay for submitting transactions to the network's [public ledger](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#p).

**Powering Decentralized Infrastructure**

**Public Ledgers**

PHI Smart Chain has two official public ledgers, [**PHI** (mainnet)](https://explorer.phi.network), and **Divine Testnet** (testnet). Anyone can connect and use both public ledgers, and **Divine Testnet** is a great place for developers to build and test their applications without any financial risk, as you can acquire the network's native token, Divine TST (DTS), for free.

#### Private Ledgers <a href="#private-ledgers" id="private-ledgers"></a>

PHI Network can also be deployed on a [private and controlled environment](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#p), which is ideal for governmental, development, and enterprise-level applications. Our company also develops and maintains a full suite of applications that facilitate and promote the usage of PHI Network with privately controlled ledgers, that allows users to create and deploy a production blockchain with just a few clicks.

#### Compatibility & Interoperability <a href="#compatibility-and-interoperability" id="compatibility-and-interoperability"></a>

PHI Smart Chain leverages on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#e) for its [smart contracts,](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s) and this means that its platforms, tokens, protocols, and [dApps](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#d) are compatible and interoperable with other networks that uses the same algorithm to calculate addresses, and EVM for smart contract compatibility. Some major examples of other networks that can be deemed compatible with PHI Network are **Ethereum**, **Avalanche**, **Fantom Opera**, and **Binance Smart Chain**.

#### Hybrid Consensus Algorithm <a href="#hybrid-consensus-approach" id="hybrid-consensus-approach"></a>

[Hybrid Consensus Algorithm,](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/hybrid-consensus-approach) or HCA for short, is a novel structuring standard for decentralized infrastructure, which ensures speed, high throughput, and quick finality, without compromising security and decentralization.

#### Key Features <a href="#key-features" id="key-features"></a>

#### Speed & Block Size <a href="#speed-and-block-size" id="speed-and-block-size"></a>

PHI Smart Chain can achieve [finality](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#f) in just a few seconds, with a [block size](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#b) on average 100000x greater than most other blockchain networks. The structure PHI uses to validate and seal blocks also strongly influences the blocks' mining time. This allows better management of difficulty and [hashpower](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#h) to achieve optimal performance and consistency.

#### Security <a href="#security" id="security"></a>

The security inherent to the [PoW](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#p) mechanism is present on [PHI Network](https://phi.network) while still allowing it to enjoy all the benefits - including the low energy consumption - of [PoS](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#p) and [PoA](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#p) networks.

#### High Throughput <a href="#high-throughput" id="high-throughput"></a>

The greater block size, aligned with PHI's novel HCA mechanism, allows a consistent minimum of 9,995tps, and upwards of [1,000,000tps](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#t) while processing raw transactions, compared to about 7tps on Bitcoin and 13tps on Ethereum (Eth1.0).

**Smart Contract Compatible**

[PHI Smart Chain](https://explorer.phi.network) leverages the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#e) to offer [smart contract ](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#s)functionality, meaning it is 100% compatible with any platform coded in Solidity and/or deployed on any other EVM, making it possible for developers to migrate over.

#### Low Cost <a href="#low-cost" id="low-cost"></a>

The [transaction costs ](https://docs.phi.network/phi-wiki/glossary#t)are minimal, and PHI has influence mechanisms to ensure it always remains this way.
